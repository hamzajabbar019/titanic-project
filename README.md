# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project is an analysis of the Titanic dataset aimed at predicting the survival of passengers based on various features. The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket fare, and class. The goal is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic passenger data, which is available from the [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The dataset includes the following features:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Technologies Used
